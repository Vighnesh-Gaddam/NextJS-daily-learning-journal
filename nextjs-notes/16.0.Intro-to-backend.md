When we step into the **backend world**, one of the first building blocks we encounter is **HTTP methods**. Think of it like running a movie website—you’ll need different actions for managing your movies:

* **GET** to fetch the list of movies,
* **POST** to add a new movie,
* **PATCH** to update movie details,
* **DELETE** to remove a movie.

These methods are the foundation of how the client communicates with the server and how data flows in any web application.
