# 🏆 Challenge: Build Your First GET API

## 🎯 Goal

Create a **GET API** that returns a list of books with `id`, `title`, and `author`.

---

## 📝 Instructions

1. Inside `app/books/`, create a `route.ts` file.
2. Define a `books` array in `db.ts`.
3. Import the books inside `route.ts` and return them as JSON.
4. Test with Thunder Client at `http://localhost:3000/books`.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
app/
├─ movies/
│   └─ route.ts
├─ books/
│   └─ route.ts
db.ts
```

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

Visiting `/books` should return JSON:

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Atomic Habits", "author": "James Clear" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "The Pragmatic Programmer", "author": "Andrew Hunt" },
  { "id": 3, "title": "Clean Code", "author": "Robert C. Martin" }
]
```

---

## 📝 Solution

### db.ts

```ts
// db.ts
export const books = [
  { id: 1, title: "Atomic Habits", author: "James Clear" },
  { id: 2, title: "The Pragmatic Programmer", author: "Andrew Hunt" },
  { id: 3, title: "Clean Code", author: "Robert C. Martin" },
];
```

### app/books/route.ts

```ts
// app/books/route.ts
import { books } from "../../db";

export async function GET() {
  return Response.json(books);
}
```

---

✅ Now test `http://localhost:3000/books` → you’ll see the book list!
