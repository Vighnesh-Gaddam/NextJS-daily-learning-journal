# 📘 Next.js App Routing: Private Pages & Route Groups

---

## 🔐 Private Pages in Next.js

In the **App Router** (`app/` directory), you can make a route inaccessible (private) by prefixing the folder name with `_` (underscore).

### 🧪 Example:

```
app/
└── _products
└── page.tsx
```

### ❗ Behavior:
- Going to `/products` will result in a **404**.
- The `_products` folder is **not treated as a route** by Next.js.

## 🔁 Route Groups: Ignoring Folder in URL

Next.js allows you to **group pages** into folders **without affecting the URL path** by wrapping the folder name in parentheses: `()`.

This is useful for:
- Grouping related components (e.g. `auth`, `users`)
- Organizing code without exposing folder name in the URL

### 📁 Example Structure:
```
app/
└── (auth)/
├── login/
│    └── page.tsx
└── register/
└── page.tsx
```

### ✅ Behavior:
- Accessible at: `/login`, `/register`
- NOT accessible at: `/(auth)/login`, `/(auth)/register`

---

## ✅ Combining Concepts

You can **combine** route groups and private routes:

- Use `_private-folder` for internal-only pages.
- Use `(group-name)` for organizing routes without exposing them in the path.
