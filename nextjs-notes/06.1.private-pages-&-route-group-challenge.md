# 🧪 Challenge: Clean URLs with Route Groups & Hidden Routes in Next.js

---

## 🎯 Goal

* Use **route groups** (`(foldername)`) to organize files without affecting the URL.
* Use **underscore-prefixed folders** (`_foldername`) to **completely hide** folders from route paths.
* Understand how to build clean, organized, and user-friendly routes in Next.js.

---

## 📌 Challenge Task

### 🔹 Part 1: Use Route Group — `(auth)`

1. Create a folder named `(auth)` and add a `login` route that displays:
   👉 **"Please log in to see the content"**

   * ✅ Should be accessible at → `/login`
   * ❌ Should **not** be accessible at → `/auth/login`

---

### 🔹 Part 2: Use Private Folder — `_private`

2. Create a folder named `_private/admin` and inside it create a route that displays:
   👉 **"Welcome to the Admin Dashboard"**

   * ✅ Should be accessible at → `/admin`
   * ❌ Should **not** be accessible at → `/private/admin`
   * ✅ The `_private` folder should **not appear in the URL** at all

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

* [ ] Clean URLs like `/login` and `/admin`
* [ ] Folder structure remains organized and modular
* [ ] `(auth)` folder is ignored in URL path
* [ ] `_private` folder is completely hidden from route path

---

## 💡 Hint

> 🧩 Use:
>
> * `(folder)` → for grouping and organization, without affecting the URL
> * `_folder` → for hiding routes completely from the public path

# ✅ Solution

## 🗂️ Final Folder Structure

```
app/
 ├─ (auth)/
 │   └─ login/
 │       └─ page.tsx            → /login
 ├─ _private/
 │   └─ admin/
 │       └─ page.tsx            → /admin
 └─ layout.tsx
```

---

## 1. `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

```tsx
"use client";

export default function Login() {
  return <h1>Please log in to see the content</h1>;
}
```

---

## 2. `app/_private/admin/page.tsx`

```tsx
"use client";

export default function AdminDashboard() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to the Admin Dashboard</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

---

## 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 Route Testing Table

| URL              | Expected Result               | Status    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- |
| `/login`         | ✅ Renders login page          | ✅ Success |
| `/auth/login`    | ❌ 404 Not Found               | ✅ Success |
| `/admin`         | ❌ Renders admin dashboard     | ✅ Success |
| `/private/admin` | ❌ 404 Not Found (path hidden) | ✅ Success |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **`(foldername)`**: Groups routes without affecting the path. Great for organizing features like `auth`, `marketing`, or `user`.
* **`_foldername`**: Completely hides the folder from routing. Useful for internal pages like admin, settings, or restricted areas.
* Keeps URLs clean **and** your project modular.
