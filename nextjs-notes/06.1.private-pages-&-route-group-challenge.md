# Ignore Routes Using Route Groups Challenge (Exercise)

### 🎯 Goal:
- Practice using **route groups** and **private folders**.

---

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a folder:
```
app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
````
Inside it, add:
```tsx
"use client";
export default function Login() {
  return <h1>Please log in to see the content</h1>;
}
````

2. Create another route:

   ```
   app/(private)/users/user-info/page.tsx
   ```

   Inside it:

   ```tsx
   "use client";
   export default function UserInfo() {
     return (
       <>
         <h1>User Information</h1>
         <p>Here are the details about the user.</p>
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Run your app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Test it:

   * ✅ Visit `/login` → Should work.
   * ❌ Visit `/auth/login` → Should **NOT** work.
   * ✅ Visit `/user-info` → Should show user info.
   * ❌ Visit `/users/user-info` → Should show 404.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* `_foldername` hides routes completely (private).
* `(foldername)` ignores the folder name from the URL.
* Good practice for organizing code without messy URLs.
