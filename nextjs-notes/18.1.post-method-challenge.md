# 🏆 Challenge: Build Your First POST API

## 🎯 Goal

Create a **POST API** for adding a new **book** into a book list.

---

## 📝 Instructions

1. Inside `app/books/route.ts`, define a `POST` function.
2. Accept request JSON with `{ id, title, author }`.
3. Push the book into a `books` array (from `db.ts`).
4. Return the new book as JSON.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
app/
├─ books/
│   └─ route.ts
db.ts
```

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior

When sending:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "title": "Deep Work",
  "author": "Cal Newport"
}
```

API should respond:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "title": "Deep Work",
  "author": "Cal Newport"
}
```

And GET `/books` should now include the new book.

---

## 📝 Solution

### db.ts

```ts
// db.ts
export const books = [
  { id: 1, title: "Atomic Habits", author: "James Clear" },
  { id: 2, title: "The Pragmatic Programmer", author: "Andrew Hunt" },
  { id: 3, title: "Clean Code", author: "Robert C. Martin" },
];
```

### app/books/route.ts

```ts
// app/books/route.ts
import { books } from "../../db";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const book = await request.json();
  const newBook = { ...book };

  books.push(newBook);

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(newBook), {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });
}

export async function GET() {
  return Response.json(books);
}
```

---

✅ Now you can **GET all books** and **POST new books** at `http://localhost:3000/books`.
