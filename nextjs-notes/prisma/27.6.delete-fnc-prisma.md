# Deleting a Movie Using Prisma (TypeScript)

## 1. Introduction

* To **delete an existing movie**, Prisma provides the `delete` method.
* You can delete a movie by its **unique identifier**, typically the `ID`.

---

## 2. Creating the Delete Function

### 2.1 Define Async Function

* Create an asynchronous function `deleteMovie`.
* The function takes **one parameter**:

  * `movieID` → `number` (ID of the movie to delete)

```ts
async function deleteMovie(movieID: number) {
  const deletedMovie = await prisma.movie.delete({
    where: {
      id: movieID,
    },
  });
  console.log("Deleted Movie:", deletedMovie);
}
```

---

### 2.2 Key Points

1. `prisma.movie.delete()` deletes a single record.
2. `where` specifies **which movie** to delete using a unique field (ID).
3. The result of the deletion is stored in a variable (`deletedMovie`) to confirm the deleted record.

---

## 3. Executing the Function

* Call the function inside the `main()` function using `await`.

```ts
async function main() {
  await deleteMovie(1); // Delete the movie with ID 1
}
```

* This will remove the movie with ID `1` from the database.

---

## 4. Running the Script

```bash
# Using TS Node
npx ts-node src/index.ts

# Or via npm script
npm run dev
```

* After running the script, you can **refresh Prisma Studio** to see that the movie has been deleted.
* The remaining movies will retain their data (IDs 2, 3, 4, 5…).

## 5. Summary of CRUD Operations Covered

1. **Create single movie** → `prisma.movie.create()`
2. **Create multiple movies** → `prisma.movie.createMany()`
3. **Get all movies** → `prisma.movie.findMany()`
4. **Get a movie by ID** → `prisma.movie.findUnique({ where: { id }})`
5. **Update a movie** → `prisma.movie.update({ where, data })`
6. **Delete a movie** → `prisma.movie.delete({ where })`

> Notes: 99% of the time, these operations cover most use cases. For advanced queries, refer to the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs).
