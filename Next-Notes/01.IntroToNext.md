# What is [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)?
- Next.js is a popular open-source React framework that makes it easier to build fast and scalable web applications. 
- It provides a lot of built-in features like SSR, SSG, API routes, and automatic code splitting, all of which help with performance and SEO.

# React vs Next.js – Why Next.js is Needed?

## Problems with React (Before React 19)
React is a great library for building user interfaces, but there are a few things it does not handle out of the box:

1. **No Built-in Routing**  
   - React does not come with a built-in routing solution.  
   - Requires third-party libraries like **React Router** or **TanStack Router**.

2. **No Built-in Compiler (Before React 19)**  
   - React needs tools like **Babel** or **Webpack** to transform code before running in the browser.  
   - Adds extra complexity to setup.

3. **SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Issues**  
   - React mostly renders pages on the **client side**.  
   - Search engines might have trouble indexing your content properly.

4. **No Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
   - React does not handle SSR by default.  
   - Leads to slower load times as everything renders on the client.

5. **No Static Site Generation (SSG)**  
   - React doesn’t pre-render pages at build time out of the box.  
   - Requires extra configurations for SSG.

6. **Frontend Only**  
   - React is mainly a frontend library.  
   - No built-in backend logic, database integration, or server-side operations.

7. **No Enforced Folder Structure**  
   - React doesn’t impose any structure → can lead to disorganized big projects.

8. **No Built-in API Integration**  
   - API calls must be set up manually (Axios, Fetch, etc.).  
   - Adds extra steps to every project.

## How Next.js Solves These Problems
Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React.js that solves these limitations:

1. **Hot Reloading**  
   - Instant updates when changes are made during development.

2. **Built-in Compiler**  
   - No need for Babel or Webpack setup.  
   - Next.js comes with its own compiler.

3. **Built-in SEO Support**  
   - Automatic **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** and **SSG (Static Site Generation)**.  
   - Search engines can easily crawl and index pages.

4. **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**  
   - Pages are rendered on the server and sent pre-built to the client → faster initial load.

5. **SSG (Static Site Generation)**  
   - Pages can be pre-rendered at build time for even faster performance.

6. **Full-Stack Capabilities**  
   - API Routes allow backend logic and database integration inside the same Next.js project.

7. **Built-in Routing**  
   - Automatic routing based on folder structure (no extra libraries required).

8. **Performance Features**  
   - Automatic code splitting.  
   - Optimized image handling.  
   - Static site generation for improved speed.
